✅ Key Components You Might Include:
Dataset:

Did you use a dataset like the one from Kaggle (e.g., "Crop Recommendation Dataset") or collect your own?

Make sure it's balanced and clean.

Features Used:

Soil nutrients: N, P, K

pH level

Rainfall (mm)

Temperature, humidity (if available) can also improve accuracy

ML Models:

Common choices include Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, or XGBoost.

Compare model accuracy using cross-validation.

Performance Evaluation:

Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Confusion matrix to analyze misclassifications

Recommendation Output:

Based on model prediction, show the most suitable crop

Optionally include economic info or seasonality

Deployment (optional but impactful):

Web app using Streamlit, Flask, or Django

Mobile-friendly UI for real farmers

Sample Output Example:
User inputs:

N: 90

P: 42

K: 43

pH: 6.5

Rainfall: 130mm

Model prediction:

Recommended Crop: Rice

Reason: High nitrogen and rainfall, neutral pH suits rice cultivation
